One of the reasons for this, that I've slightly forgotten, is interactivity. C sucks in large part because you can't incrementally inspect and debug a program very well. C++ is worse because template metaprogramming and so on make the source text pretty distant from the "actual" program the compiler receives.

First it should be possible to deal with modules directly, e.g. adding and removing definitions from an interactively accessible module. The module should be interrogatable. Ideally it would be possible to carry out partial compilations and check the system at runtime, as by using LLVM's "JIT" facilities to make compiled Hare functions individually callable in the Lisp environment. I think this is obviously superior to IDEs maintaining a kind of shadow picture of what the compiler is doing, which is therefore somewhat disconnected from reality.

Secondly, stages should be clear. I'm envisioning Hare as having a complex macro/template/ad hoc polyrmophism system kind of like C++, and to make that analyzable, it is necessary to give the programmer the ability to see what things look like after all that is resolved - when macros are expanded and everything is monotyped. At this stage it should still be possible to see a relatively simple source correspondence.
